# Quick summary of what we learned today:

### 1️⃣ Basic print statement:

```
print("Hello world!")
```
↳ Hello world!

### 2️⃣ Using 1 print statement to show output in multiple new lines:

```
print("Hello everyone!\nMy name is Disha:)\nNice to meet you.")
```
↳ Hello everyone!  
  My name is Disha:)  
  Nice to meet you.  

### 3️⃣ Manipulating strings:

```
print("Hello"+"Friend")
```
↳ HelloFriend

```
print("Hello " + "Friend")
```
↳ Hello Friend

```
print("Hello" + " " + "Friend")
```
↳ Hello Friend

### 4️⃣ Indentation and Syntax errors:

```
 print("Pune city")
print ("Bombay banglore")
print("Flying high)
priint("Water bottle")
```

### 5️⃣ Using input function:

```
input("What is your name?")
```
↳ What is your name?Anya

```
print("Hello " + input("What is your name?") + "!")
```
↳ What is your name?Rio  
  Hello Rio!  

> [!Tip]
> *Beginners can use [thonny python IDE](https://thonny.org) to see how the code runs behind the scenes*  
> *To comment multiple lines at once, select all lines (`Ctrl+A`), then `Ctrl+/`*

### 6️⃣ Variables:

```
place = input("Where you from?\n")
print(place)
```
↳ Where you from?  
  Goa  
  Goa

```
var = "random string"
print(var)
```
↳ random string

```
print(len(input("Enter string: ")))
```
↳ Enter string: flowers  
  7  

*len() function prints the length of string*

### 7️⃣ Variable naming:

*Although you can name your varaible as you wish, but some best practices will help in the long run (like when you need to come back to your code and understand everything again).*  

*Best Practices for naming variables:-*  
*1. Avoid using single alphabets as variable names.*  
*2. Avoid starting variable names with numerals. You can postfix the numerals in variable name, if needed.*  
*3. For longer variable names, do not use spaces. Instead, use underscore between words.*  
*4. Use names such that they make sense to everyone and are easy to understand.*
